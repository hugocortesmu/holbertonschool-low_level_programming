  You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
  In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you d  on’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at   compilation.
